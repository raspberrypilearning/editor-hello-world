<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Print Hello</h2>

--- task ---

In Python, `print()` outputs text (words or numbers) to the screen.
Type the code to `print()` Hello to the screen:

--- /task ---

Your code should look like this:

--- code ---
---
language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 8
---
# variables
world = '🌍🌎🌏'
python = 'Python 🐍'
fire = '🔥'

# Function definitions        
  
# Put code to run under here
print(f'Hello')
--- /code ---

--- tip ---

When you type an opening bracket `(` the code editor will automatically add a closing bracket `)` 
This also happens when you type an opening apostrophe `'`.

--- /tip ---

This is what you should see when you run your code.

--- output ---

```
Hello
```

--- /output ---

--- debug ---

If you get an error then check your code really carefully. Check there are single quotes around `Hello` so Python knows it is meant to be text.

--- /debug ---
