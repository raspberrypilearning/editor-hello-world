## Using modules

--- task ---

Python has many modules that you can use in your code to help perform certain tasks. To use a module, you first need to **import** it. The `datetime` module helps writing code that uses dates and times.

--- /task ---

Import the `datetime` module on the first line of code in your file.

--- code ---
---
language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 1, 2
---
# imports
from datetime import datetime

# variables
--- /code ---

--- tip ---

Any text you write in Python with a `#` in front of it becomes a comment. These lines won't run, so they can be useful to help people read and understand your code.

--- /tip ---

When you run this code, nothing should change, and you should have the same output as the pervious step.

--- debug ---

Check that you have spelled `datetime` correctly, and it is all lowercase.
