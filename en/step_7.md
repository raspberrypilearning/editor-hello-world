<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Using modules</h2>

--- task ---

Python has many **modules** that you can use in your code to help perform certain tasks. To use a module, you first need to **import** it. 

The `datetime` module helps with writing code that uses dates and times.

Import the `datetime` module on the first line of code in your file.

### Tip

Any text you write in Python with a `#` in front of it becomes a comment. These lines won't run, so they can be useful to help people read and understand your code.

</div>

When you run this code, nothing should change, and you should have the same output as the previous step.

### Debugging

Check that you have spelled `datetime` correctly, and it is all lowercase.
