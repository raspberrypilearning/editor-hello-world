Add two more `print()` lines to your code including a multiplication for Python to calculate:

--- code ---
---
language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 10
line_highlights: 13-14

# Put code to run under here
print(f'Hello {world}')
print(f'Welcome to {python}')
print(f'{python} is good at maths!')
print(f'{111111111 * 111111111}')

--- /code ---

**Test:** Click the **Run** button.
This is what you should see when you run your code.

### Tip

Python uses the same rules for calculations as you might have learned at school. **B**rackets first, then **O**rders, **D**ivision, **M**ultiplication, **A**ddition, and lastly **S**ubtraction.

### Debugging

Don't forget that the UPPERCASE and lowercase letters are important in Python. Always check you are using the correct case.
