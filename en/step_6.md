# Put code to run under here
print(f'Hello {world}')
print(f'Welcome to {python}')
print(f'{python} is good at maths!')

### Tip

Python uses the same rules for calculations as you might have learned at school. *B*rackets first, then **O**rders, **D**ivision, **M**ultiplication, **A**ddition, and lastly **S**ubtraction

</div>

This is what you should see when you run your code.

<div class="c-project-output">
```
Hello 🌍🌎🌏
Welcome to Python 🐍
Python 🐍 is good at maths!

```
</div>

<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--debug">

### Debugging

Don't forget that the UPPERCASE and lowercase letters are important in Python. Always check you are using the correct case.
