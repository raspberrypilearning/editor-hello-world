<h2 class="c-project-heading--explainer">Functions</h2>

Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They can be used over and over again.

Here is an example of a function:

--- code ---
---
language: python
line_numbers: false
---

# Function definitions
def add_one_and_one():
    x = 1 + 1
    print(x)

--- /code ---

The name of this function is `add_one_and_one`. 

The code for the task you want the function to do needs to be **indented**, which means that you need to add **four spaces** before each line of code.

**Calling** a function runs the code inside it. You **call** a function by using its name. In this case `add_one_and_one()`.
