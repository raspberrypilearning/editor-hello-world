## Print variables

--- task ---

Change your code to also `print()` the contents of the `world` variable. You can do this by adding the variable name in curly brackets `{}`

--- /task ---

Your code should look like this:

--- code ---
---
language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 8
---
# variables
world = '🌍🌎🌏'
python = 'Python 🐍'
fire = '🔥'

# Function definitions        
  
# Put code to run under here
print(f'Hello {world}')
--- /code ---

--- tip ---

The `f` character inside the print, lets you easily print variables along with strings of text.

--- /tip ---

This is what you should see when you run your code.

--- output ---

```python
Hello 🌍🌎🌏
```

--- /output ---

--- debug ---

If you get an error then check you have opened and closed all your brackets `()` and curly brackets `{}`

--- /debug ---
