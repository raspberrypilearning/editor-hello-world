<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Roll dice</h2>

--- task ---

Create a function called `roll_dice()`, that prints out a number that you can choose. Then call the function at the bottom of your code.

--- /task ---

Your code should look like this:

--- code ---
---
language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 8
---
# Function definitions        

def roll_dice():
    print(f'You rolled a {4}')
    
# Put code to run under here
--- /code ---

--- code ---
---
language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 8
---
print(f'{111111111 * 111111111}')
print(f'The date and time is {datetime.now()}')
roll_dice()
--- /code ---

--- tip ---

You can use the **Tab** key on your keyboard to insert 4 spaces. Pressing **Shift** and **Tab** will remove the 4 spaces.

--- /tip ---

This is what you should see when you run your code.
