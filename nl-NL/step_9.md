<h2 class="c-project-heading--explainer">Functions</h2>

Functions can be used in Python to perform specific tasks. They are blocks of code that can be used over and over again.

A function needs a name, and then the code that is going to go in the function.

Code in a function needs to be **indented**, which means that you need to add **four spaces** before each line of code.

Most code editors add the indentation for you.

Here is an example of a function:

## --- code ---

language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights:
-------------------------------------

# Function definitions

def my_function():
x = 1 + 1
print(x)
\--- /code ---

**Calling** a function runs the code inside it. You **call** a function by using its name. In this case `my_function()`.

</div>
